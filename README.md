# Heart Disease Prediction (Cleveland UCI)

Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide. This project applies a supervised learning approach to predict heart disease presence based on key clinical features. The model demonstrated high predictive performance with an emphasis on balanced evaluation metrics, aiming to support early detection efforts.

This project implements a classification model to predict the presence of heart disease using the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle. It follows a structured, end-to-end machine learning pipeline including data acquisition, cleaning, exploratory analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
